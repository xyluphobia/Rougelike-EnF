TERMS OF USE:
------------
* You may use this pack on both commercial AND non-commercial projects, just remember to add a link to my itch page and/or Twitter/Instagram, it helps a lot :) (Links below)

Included are the spritesheets for each character in three sizes (100%, 200% and 300%), .png format, transparent background.

Frame size depends on the file, but they all fit a 16x16 grid. To know the exact frame size of a character, you need to divide file size by the number of columns (for width) or rows (for height). For example, Owlbear_attack.png's file size is 320x256px, and it has 5 columns and 4 rows. 320/5 = 64 , and 256/4 = 64. Thus, frame size is 64x64px.
